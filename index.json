This requires us to find the port with nmap or do packet sniffing with tcpdump after the ARP spoofing.\nThis writeup uses the packet sniffing method.\nWe’ll perform ARP spoofing to intercept network traffic between the client and server.\nARP is a communication protocol that links IP and MAC addresses.\nARP spoofing is an attack that occurs on local networks where devices communicate using frames, which include the source and destination MAC addresses - that is OSI Layer 2.\nThe attack poisons the ARP caches by sending ARP messages to the hosts on the network, pretending to be someone else. Thus, all packets will be sent to the spoofed addresses.\nTo execute this attack, we need arpspoof to spoof the IP addresses of the two other hosts.\narpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.0.24 192.168.0.153 \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026amp; arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.0.153 192.168.0.24 \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026amp; IP forwarding is required so the kernel can send the packets to the original destination.

Connect to the server. Library I\u0026rsquo;ve been developing this little book library app in Go, but I think something is wrong with the way it\u0026rsquo;s handling book requests. Some of the book titles seem to be giving unexpected results\u0026hellip; Maybe you can figure it out?\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;html/template\u0026#34; \u0026#34;log\u0026#34; \u0026#34;net/http\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; ) type ReadBook struct{} func (rb ReadBook) ReadBook(filePath string) string { content, err := os.ReadFile(filePath) if err != nil { return \u0026#34;Error reading file: \u0026#34; + err.Error() } return string(content) } var books = map[string]string{ \u0026#34;1984\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1984 is a dystopian social science fiction novel by George Orwell.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;brave_new_world\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Brave New World is a dystopian novel by Aldous Huxley.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;f451\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by Ray Bradbury.\u0026#34;, } type Book struct { Title string Param string } func homeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { var bookList []Book for key := range books { bookList = append(bookList, Book{ Title: key, Param: key, }) } tmpl := template.Must(template.ParseFiles(\u0026#34;templates/home.html\u0026#34;)) tmpl.Execute(w, bookList) } func bookHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { userBook := r.URL.Query().Get(\u0026#34;book\u0026#34;) bookContent, validBook := books[userBook] if validBook { tmpl := template.Must(template.ParseFiles(\u0026#34;templates/book.html\u0026#34;)) tmpl.Execute(w, bookContent) return } if userBook != \u0026#34;\u0026#34; { tmpl, err := template.New(\u0026#34;book\u0026#34;).Parse(userBook) if err != nil { http.Error(w, \u0026#34;Template parsing error: \u0026#34;+err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError) return } tmpl.Execute(w, ReadBook{}) return } http.Error(w, \u0026#34;No book specified\u0026#34;, http.StatusBadRequest) } func main() { port := os.Getenv(\u0026#34;PORT\u0026#34;) if port == \u0026#34;\u0026#34; { port = \u0026#34;8080\u0026#34; // Default to 8080 if no PORT environment variable is set } http.Handle(\u0026#34;/static/\u0026#34;, http.StripPrefix(\u0026#34;/static/\u0026#34;, http.FileServer(http.Dir(\u0026#34;static\u0026#34;)))) http.HandleFunc(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, homeHandler) http.HandleFunc(\u0026#34;/books\u0026#34;, bookHandler) log.Println(\u0026#34;Starting server on port \u0026#34; + port) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;+port, nil)) } A simple web page built with Go and its template system.\nThe homepage lists all book titles in the library, each linking to a book page with a description. It uses a GET parameter, \u0026ldquo;book,\u0026rdquo; to pass the title and handle the request.\nThe file containing the logic is main.go, and two html files inside directory \u0026ldquo;templates\u0026rdquo;\nThe function of interest here is bookHandler, which processes the book requests.\nThis is what happens: Here\u0026rsquo;s the process:\nuserBook is assigned the GET parameter \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo;. bookContent, validBook access and retrieve the content from the books map. If validBook is true, the book\u0026rsquo;s description is displayed in the book.html template. Nothing out of the ordinary. If validBook is false, it checks whether userBook is non-empty, creates a new template named book , and parses userBook, which can contain Go template syntax. Finally, it executes the template with an empty instance of ReadBook{}.\nNo input validation or sanitization. This allows template injetion.\nIn the beginning of the code, you can see the defined empty struct and then the defined function/method ReadBook() for the above-mentioned empty struct. The function has a parameter filePath, and the file at that location is opened, read, and the content returned.\nReferring to Go\u0026rsquo;s html/template documentation, in order to do the injection we need to use the template syntax - {{ }} and . to access the template\u0026rsquo;s passed argument - ReadBook{} which can read a file.\nLets try books?book={{.ReadBook \u0026ldquo;/etc/passwd\u0026rdquo;}}\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin ....

The input from the buffer is written to var_12. Later in the code, the value 0xDEADBEEFCAFEBABE is moved to the rax register, followed by a cmp instruction that compares rax to var_8. A conditional jump (jnz) occurs if the ZERO FLAG (ZF) is not set.\nThe ZERO FLAG remains unset if var_8 does not equal 0xDEADBEEFCAFEBABE. When this happens, the code jumps to location loc_1263, where var_12 is read and printed along with \u0026ldquo;Nice to meet you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. If var_8 does equal 0xDEADBEEFCAFEBABE, ZF is set, the jump is skipped, and the code calls the win function.\nThe pseudocode\nThe win function provides the flag.\nIn this section of the code, 16 bytes are allocated on the stack, presumably for the filename. The registers are then set up for the sys_open and sys_sendfile syscalls.\nTo summarize, user input is taken and written to var_12, which is 10 bytes long, with no input validation. To obtain the flag, we need to write 0xDEADBEEFCAFEBABE to var_8 via a buffer overflow.\nWe can use echo with the -e option to enable the backslash escape and pipe the input to netcat.\n","permalink":"https://hexed.space/posts/metactf-buffer-1/","summary":"In this challenge, we are provided with an executable, as well as an address and a port to connect to via netcat.\nAfter connecting, we are asked to enter a name.
